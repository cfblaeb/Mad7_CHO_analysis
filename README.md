# Mad7_CHO_analysis
A jupyter notebook for processesing and analysis of NGS data from our study on Mad7 in CHO cells

Most instructions are in the notebook itself, but to read that you need python with jupyterlab (tested on python 3.9.2 with jupyterlab 3.0.12).  
In the notebook, the additional requirements are explained.  

To do anything interesting with this notebook you also need the raw data which can be obtained [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5020293)
